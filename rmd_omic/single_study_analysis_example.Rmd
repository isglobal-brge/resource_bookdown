Let us illustrate how to perform transcriptomic data analysis using data from [TCGA project](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga). We have uploaded to the opal server a resource called `tcga_liver` whose URL is http://duffel.rail.bio/recount/TCGA/rse_gene_liver.Rdata which is available through the [recount project](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/). This resource contains the `RangeSummarizedExperiment` with the RNAseq profiling of liver cancer data from TCGA. Next, we illustrate how a differential expression analysis to compare RNAseq profiling of women vs men (variable `gdc_cases.demographic.gender`). The DGE analysis is normally performed using `r Biocpkg("limma")` package. In that case, as we are analyzing RNA-seq data, `limma + voom` method will be required. 

Let us start by creating the connection to the opal server:
  
```{r pipeline_gene_expr}
builder <- newDSLoginBuilder()
builder$append(server = "study1", url = "https://opal-demo.obiba.org", 
               user = "dsuser", password = "password", 
               resource = "RSRC.tcga_liver",
               profile = "omics", driver = "OpalDriver")

logindata <- builder$build()

conns <- datashield.login(logins = logindata, assign = TRUE, 
                          symbol = "res")
```

Then, let us coerce the resource to a `RangedSummarizedExperiment` which is the type of object that is available in the [recount project](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/).

```{r get_rse}
datashield.assign.expr(conns, symbol = "rse", 
                       expr = quote(as.resource.object(res)))
ds.class("rse")
```

The number of features and samples can be inspected by

```{r dim_rse}
ds.dim("rse")
```

And the names of the features using the same function used in the case of analyzing an `ExpressionSet`

```{r name_feature_rse}
name.features <- ds.featureNames("rse")
lapply(name.features, head)
```

Also the covariate names can be inspected by

```{r name_covar_rse}
name.vars <- ds.featureData("rse")
lapply(name.vars, head, n=15)
```

We can visualize the levels of the variable having gender information

```{r table_gender}
ds.table("rse$gdc_cases.demographic.gender")
```


The differential expression analysis is then performed by:
  
  
```{r voom_gender}
ans.gender <- ds.limma(model =  ~ gdc_cases.demographic.gender, 
                       Set = "rse", type.data = "RNAseq", 
                       sva = FALSE)
```

Notice that we have set `type.data='RNAseq'` to consider that our data are counts obtained from a RNA-seq experiment. By indicating so, the differential analysis is performed by using  `voom` + `limma` as previously mention.

The top differentially expressed genes can be visualized by:
  
```{r show_ans.gender}
ans.gender
```


We have also implemented two other functions `ds.DESeq2` and `ds.edgeR` that perform DGE analysis using [DESeq2](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) and [edgeR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf) methods. This is the R code used to that purpose:

We close the DataSHIELD session by:
  
```{r close_ds2}
datashield.logout(conns)
```
